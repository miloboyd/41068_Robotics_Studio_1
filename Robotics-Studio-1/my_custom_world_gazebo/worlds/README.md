# Gazebo World Files

This repository contains Gazebo world files representing different warehouse environments. These world files are designed for simulation and testing purposes and can be used with the Gazebo simulator to evaluate various robotics algorithms, including pathfinding and navigation.


## Available World Files

### Final Warehouse

- **File Name:** `final_warehouse.world`
- **Description:** The `final_warehouse.world` file represents a large-scale, realistic warehouse environment. It is designed to mimic a real-world warehouse setting and provides a challenging environment for testing and development.

### Compact Warehouse

- **File Name:** `compact_warehouse.world`
- **Description:** The `compact_warehouse.world` file represents a small, simplified warehouse environment. It is ideal for quick code testing and debugging due to its smaller size and simplicity.

### Complex Warehouse

- **File Name:** `complex_warehouse.world`
- **Description:** The `complex_warehouse.world` file features an unorthodox and intricate warehouse layout. This environment is specifically designed to test and challenge pathfinding algorithms with unique and complex obstacles.
